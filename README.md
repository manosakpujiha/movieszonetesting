| **Boundary Value Analysis**   | Handles edge cases for input fields like search or registration.                    | Test inputs at minimum, maximum, and just outside boundaries.                                             | Unit Testing, System Testing                                        |
| **Equivalence Partitioning**  | Tests valid/invalid inputs without redundancy.                                      | Group inputs into equivalence classes and test one from each.                                              | Unit Testing, Acceptance Testing                                    |
| **Decision Table Testing**    | Systematically evaluates all combinations of conditions and outcomes.               | Create decision tables for features like login or search filters.                                         | Integration Testing, System Testing                                 |
| **State Transition Testing**  | Ensures proper state changes (e.g., logged out â†’ logged in).                        | Map states and transitions; test each action-triggered state change.                                      | System Testing, UI Testing                                          |
| **Use Case Testing**          | Tests key workflows, such as movie searching or watchlist updates.                  | Identify use cases, define steps, and validate outcomes.                                                  | Acceptance Testing, System Testing                                  |
| **Exploratory Testing**       | Identifies hidden issues through unscripted interactions.                           | Manually interact with the app and document unexpected behaviors.                                         | Usability Testing, System Testing                                   |

## *ðŸ”µDetails of Tests Implemented*
### â€¢ Testing types and techniques applied.
### â€¢ Explanations of how each test was implemented.
### â€¢ Code snippets or references to relevant code files.


## *ðŸ”µChallenges Faced and Solutions Applied*

#### Landing Page Unit Tests
*Contributor:* Sandra Justus

- *Obstacle:* 
  - Encountered an error related to HTMLFormElement.prototype.submit not being implemented in the test environment.
- *Solution:* 
  - Refactored the button click test to use preventDefault in the handleClick function, avoiding the actual form submission during the test.

- *Obstacle:* 
  - Difficulty ensuring that the changeScreen function was called when the "GET STARTED" button was clicked.
- *Solution:* 
  - Mocked the changeScreen function and verified its invocation using jest.fn().

#### Nav Component Unit Tests
*Contributor:* Manos Akpujiha

- *Obstacle:* 
  - Tests failed to locate elements like the navigation logo and avatar due to the absence of accessible roles or matching queries.
- *Solution:* 
  - Added alt attributes (e.g., alt="logo", alt="avatar") and utilized getByAltText queries to accurately target elements.

- *Obstacle:* 
  - Challenges with simulating the "scroll" event for testing the dynamic class application (nav__black).
- *Solution:* 
  - Used window.scrollTo to programmatically trigger the scroll event and verified class changes using assertions.

- *Obstacle:* 
  - Ensuring proper integration with Redux for tests involving user state.
- *Solution:* 
  - Mocked the Redux store using redux-mock-store to test scenarios with and without user data effectively.

### Summary
Both components faced environment-specific issues and challenges simulating user interactions. Each obstacle was resolved through strategic use of mocks, utility functions, and proper test environment configurations, ensuring accurate and reliable test results.
